# portal 1 multiplayer
"fixes" multiplayer for portal 1

its a source mod, install it like a source mod dummy(download the github)

run sv_client_predict 0 when starting a server

servers must have a max player count of 32, no more, no less.

stuff will be broken for obvious reasons

includes an (incomplete) version of the campaign designed for multiplayer, playable assuming everyone has a low ping, higher pings can result in velocities not being applied

still prone to random crashing but a lot less

i literally changed a single byte using a hex editor and that fixed portals for the most part
