# portal 1 multiplayer
fixes multiplayer for portal 1
run sv_client_predict 0 when starting a server
servers must have a max player count of 32, no more, no less.
stuff will be broken for obvious reasons
includes a version of the campaign designed for multiplayer, playable assuming everyone has a low ping, higher pings can result in velocities not being applied
still prone to random crashing but a lot less
i literally changed a single byte using a hex editor and that fixed it
